## About Me
I love working on software that people use. Iâ€™m happiest working at scale, and I like digging deep into how computers work and tinkering with new technologies. I have no qualms about getting my hands dirty with legacy code. In my experience with systems that are opaque, slow, or unreliable, small pragmatic changes can go a long way.

Iâ€™m very comfortable with Golang, C#, TypeScript/JavaScript, Linux, Windows, talking to databases and queues, and building out systems end-to-end. I also do some Python, Java and C, but they are not my comfort zones (yet). I live in Hanoi, Vietnam.
